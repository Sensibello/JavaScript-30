Add a class of 'playing' to an element. 
i.e. - hit a key, makes a sound

Every key on keyboard, there is something called a 'key code'
It's associated with that 'key' - the sound.
resource: keycode.info - each key has an associated 'key' with JS

ex: hit '65' - check for 'A' key - assign with JS, assign with data-key and a 'sound'

Data attributes allow this to happen. Data attributes allow to hook up with a data, and then align with a data-key element ('audio' in this case)
